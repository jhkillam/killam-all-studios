            <h2>Stars of Astraea</h2>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://linktr.ee/starsofastraea">Stars of Astraea</a> is my current major project in which I contribute to writing rhythm guitars, drums, and bass. I also handle the production aspects of the project which includes mixing/mastering our tracks and editing videos. I am also responsible for working with the distribution companies to make our music available on modern platforms.</p>

            <p>Our latest original release is titled "Without a Casket", which is our first single from an upcoming EP. We have also recently released some covers by artists such as <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/lxJn0KjTfxQ">Slipknot</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/V-L_vhDe7tQ">Tony Danza Tapdance Extravaganza</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MKAgVHNJOQE">Wage War</a>.</p>

            <p>This group had its beginnings sometime around 2013/2014 when I started writing songs on the 8-string with Jules, and we released a few demos on SoundCloud under the name <strong>GK</strong>.</p>

            <p>A few years later we met our vocalist Amanda and released our first original single "Aggravation" in 2019.</p>

            <h2>Megalixir</h2>

            <p>Megalixir started in 2012 when I found a classified ad posted by guitarist Sam on the (sadly) now-defunct Mike Portnoy forum. Sam was seeking a drummer to compliment him and bassist Joe to create re-imagined prog rock/metal versions of classic video game music. I was hesitant to reply at first since I wasn't in a position at the time to record live drums, and had only just started dabbling with creating virtual drum performances with MIDI. </p>

            <p>I decided to give it a shot and we hit it off right away with a cover of a Duck Tales song.</p>

            <p>Sam had been talking with a couple of guys, Tyler and Dave, who were about to launch a podcast, TADPOG: Tyler and Dave Play Old Games, where they were playing through IGN's top 100 Super Nintendo games, and we worked out a deal with them where we would cover a song from games on the list to be featured occasionally on their podcast. After the first couple of tracks for the podcast, Sam made a connection with a chiptunes artist in Norway mystically known as Kartmaze who began contributing by writing synth parts for the songs.</p> 
            
            <p>This work with TADPOG culminated with a medley we titled "you.confront.the.abstract.art", featuring tracks from games Lufia 2, Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, and Final Fight. We released this track on Bandcamp along with two other medleys, one from the 1994 SNES game Demon's Crest entitled "metropolis.pt.3" and the other from 1993's Elemental Master on Sega Genesis, titled "brother".</p>

            <p>Other tracks that were created for the podcast are featured on our Bandcamp on the <i><a target="_blank" href="https://megalixir1.bandcamp.com/album/b-sides">b.sides</a></i> album. We are currently working on an original album, and have also done a few Metallica covers for fun, one of which I got to flex my bass chops.</p>

            <h2>Killing In Apathy</h2>

            <p>My relationship with Killing In Apathy goes all the way back to sometime around 2004/2005. We jammed on and off with me playing drums for the group and trying to figure out how to properly record some demos. After several lineup changes, I ended up moving from Austin to Houston for a job opportunity while they carried on writing and playing shows. Since that time we have worked together several times with them enlisting me as their producer and mix/master engineer. We released the <i>Death & Taxes</i> EP in 2013 and <i>Rogues Gallery: Cell Block A</i> in 2022. A follow-up to <i>Rogues Gallery</i> is in progress as of May 2022.</p>

            <h2>Killam</h2>

            <p>That's me. I've done a ton of random one-off songs myself over the years, some originals and some covers. It's always in a state of disarray, so there's not much to show here. But I did find one of my oldest recordings ever, probably from some time around 2001/2002 where I (tried) to cover Slayer's "Reign In Blood", including vocals. So this is your prize (or punishment?) for making it this far.</p>
