        <h1>Studio</h1>
        
        <p>
            My studio setup has evolved significantly over the years. Pictured below is my current setup which I run on a Windows 10 desktop PC that I built myself. Key hardware and software for my workflow includes:

            <p id="center">Here's a fun trip down memory lane taking a look at my previous setups over the years. </p>
        
            <h2>2000</h2>
        
            <img id="border" src="../images/2000.jpg" alt="2000" />
            <p>
            At the point this picture was taken (which might not actually have been the year 2000), I'd been poking around on my dad's Mac PowerPC system running Pro Tools for a few years. Along with my buddies Jack & Tink, we tracked a punk album all by ourself over the course of a weekend. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>2006</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2006.jpg" alt="2006" />
            <p>
                Venturing out on my own meant I couldn't rely on my dad's equipment anymore for recording, and after experimenting with a simple 8 track digital recorder I quickly realized Pro Tools was the only way for me to really get the type of results I wanted. I sold the 8 track and upgraded to a MacBook Pro with a DIGI002 I/O, pictured above mixing something in the classic U-Haul storage shed jam space. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>2009</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2009.jpg" alt="2009" />
            <p>
                Finally a (tiny) desk of my own! My wife and I moved to Houston to try and level up our careers in 2008 and small apartment life was a challenge for studio space. My messy nature didn't help!
            </p>

            <h2>2011</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2011.jpg" alt="2011" />
            <p>
                It was always important to me for my rig to be very mobile for working anywhere. Also at this point I had upgraded to a Mac Mini as seen in the photo. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>2012</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2012.jpg" alt="2012" />
            <p>
                In 2012 I was fortunate enough to get some more space with a bigger desk, more screens and speakers, but OOF! So messy still! This setup spawned the beginnings of what would become <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgBtshIff79svlVD_5xQrsg/featured">Stars of Astraea</a>. 
            </p>

            <h2>2016</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2016.jpg" alt="2016" />
            <p>
               New Macbook Pro, better screen setup, and ALMOST an organized desk! You can also see the first iteration of my desktop PC in a GIANT case on the floor. I had no idea what I was doing so I bought a huge case thinking it would be better for airflow, turned out to be totally unnecessary.  
            </p>

            <h2>2017</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2017.jpg" alt="2017" />
            <p>
               Lots of upgrades here! Matching screens, proper speaker monitors, and nice new 9' desk. Clean AF!
            </p>

            <h2>2018</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2018.jpg" alt="2018" />
            <p>
               Still keeping it clean, now featuring amazing artwork & d√©cor from my lovely wife. Somehow the DIGI002 is still going strong here as well 12 years later. 
            </p>

            <h2>2020</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2020.jpg" alt="2020" />
            <p>
               In 2020 I made some significant upgrades, including new 4K screens and finally retiring the DIGI002 in favor of the Presonus 18|24. After all the years of sending money to Avid for Pro Tools, I also started experimenting with other Digital Audio Workstations such as Logic and REAPER. I quickly found that I preferred REAPER, and also started working with it more frequently on the desktop PC as my MacBook Pro was not aging well. 
            </p>

            <h2>2022</h2>
            
            <img id="border" src="../images/2022.jpg" alt="2022" />
            <p>
               And finally, here we are in 2022.
