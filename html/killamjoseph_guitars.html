                    This Schecter Damien Platinum 8-string is one of my favorites to play. It has a longer scale length than all of my other guitars at 28", which allows for it to handle lower tunings with ease. It is typically kept in F# standard tuning but is also occasionally used for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8DlaPvnnX8">Drop E</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TaH6CSRAsQ">Double Drop D</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-L_vhDe7tQ">other unusual tunings</a>.

                <p>
                    This Epiphone Les Paul 7-string was my first extended range guitar, which I found in a pawn shop way back in probably 2006 or 2007. I used this guitar extensively while I was performing with The Pant Factory in 2009-2010. This guitar is typically kept in B standard tuning.

                <img src="../images/legator-7.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    This Legator Ninja 7-string is the main guitar I'm currently using for Stars of Astraea. I upgraded the pickups myself to Seymour Duncan Blackouts which greatly improved the sound compared to the stock Legator pickups. It is primarily kept in Drop G tuning for Stars of Astraea, however I often use other unusual tunings such as F# for the low string and then Drop B for other 6 strings for my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18W4_yqpU3o">Veil of Maya cover medley</a>. It is the first guitar I purchased that has fanned frets, which allows for better tension in low tunings without requiring excessively high string gauges.

                <p>
                    This Legator Ninja 6-string is my most recent addition, purchased direct from Legator as a "b-stock" model, but there's not a scratch on it. I also replaced the Legator pickups, using an EMG 81/60 combo in this one. It's also typically kept in Drop G for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHKaYsiX4Jc">Stars of Astraea songs</a>.

                    This Carvin was my first serious guitar, purchased I believe in 1998 or 1999. It is a DIY-style kit guitar that comes as raw wood with the the electronics already attached to the pickguard. We used a simple natural tung oil finish on the wood before assembly. This is also my only guitar with a whammy bar.

                <img src="../images/carvin-red.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    This is another kit guitar from Carvin, which I got a few years after the first one. It has a different pickup configuration with 3 humbuckers and a fixed bridge. Recently I replaced the bridge pickup with a Seymour Duncan Nazg√ªl. This was the first guitar that I started experimenting with tunings much lower than standard, and now I typically keep it in a tuning based around A or B.

                    This guitar is AWESOME! However... although it says ESP Custom on the headstock, sadly that's not what it is. I got it used from Guitar Center, and turns out whoever sold it to them put that decal themself, underneath the diamond plate cover it has the LTD logo which is ESP's budget line. GC offered to refund me upon discovering this, however I still wanted the guitar and negotiated the price down to just $400.

                <p>
                    One of the weirder guitars in my collection, affectionately known as the "Franken-V." My dad found the body and neck separately on Ebay years ago, ordered them and put this hot red paintjob on the body to match the headstock then put it all together. I also have a fretless neck that fits this body which makes for a really weird time!

            <div>
                <img src="../images/epiphone-coronet.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    This is a vintage gem of a guitar, an Epiphone Coronet which I believe to be originally built in 1965. My dad traded a cargo van for this guitar and a Fender Deluxe Reverb amplifier from the same era. The original pickup has been swapped out for a Seymour Duncan Hotrails, which gives a humbucker-style sound while still fitting in the single-coil sized cutout.

                <p>
                    Another interesting one here, this Fender Stratocaster originally belonged to my dad who happens to be left handed. He gave it to me some time ago and I had it flipped around to play right handed so I can get that special Strat sound whenever needed!

                <img src="../images/danelectro.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    This was my first guitar that I started learning on, very cool look with the vintage lipstick-style pickups. 
                </p>

                <img src="../images/carvin-bass-5.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    My first bass, another DIY kit build from Carvin in a 5-string configuration. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="../images/rogue-bass-8.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    A very interesting one, this 8-string bass gives a unique tone similar to a 12-string guitar with the octave-spaced tuning. Featured on the GK track <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/killamallstudios/the-future-is-for-sale">The Future is For Sale</a>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="../images/bass.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    I wish I knew more about this bass, but there's not much identifying detail on it. It belonged to my mom and was recently passed down to me. It has a very unique vintage tone with the nylon strings. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="../images/takamine.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    My first and only standard acoustic guitar from Takamine. Very clear bright tone on this!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img src="../images/classical.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    This classical-style guitar also belonged to my mom before being passed down to me. Another one that I wish I knew more about the history behind it, but regardless it plays and sounds amazing. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div id="flex-triple">
                <img id="triple" src="../images/triple-neck.jpg" /> 
                <p>
                    Last but obviously not least... this thing is a monster. Featuring a 12, 7, and 6-string neck, it plays like a nightmare and brings me nothing but pain. And I love it. I played this live only once with what would eventually become The Pant Factory at a Battle of the Bands, performing an insane Dream Theater medley. More recently, I've written and recorded a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGB1rmulyd4">demo for Stars of Astraea</a> using this. Hopefully that one never gets played live though!
